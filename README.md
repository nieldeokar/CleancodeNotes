# Clean Code Notes
This repo contains notes from book [Clean Code : A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin][1]


## Quotes :

1. It was the bad code that brought the company down.  
2. LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.  
3. But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. We are unprofessional.  
4. Writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Being able to recognize good art from
bad does not mean that we know how to paint.  
5. Being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!  
6. When the same thing is done over and over, it’s a sign that there is an idea in our mind that is not well represented in the code. I try to figure out what it is. Then I try to express that idea more clearly.  

### What is clean code ?
**Bjarne Stroustrup** inventor of C++ :  
*I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.*  

**Grady Booch** author of Object :  
*Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.*  

**Big Dave Thomas** founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy :  
*Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.*

**Michael Feathers** author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code :  
*I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you—code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.*  

**Ron Jeffries** author of Extreme Programming Installed and Extreme Programming Adventures in C# :  
*In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck’s rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code:  
• Runs all the tests;  
• Contains no duplication;  
• Expresses all the design ideas that are in the
system;  
• Minimizes the number of entities such as classes,
methods, functions, and the like.*  

**Ward Cunningham**  inventor of Wiki, inventor of Fit, coinventor of eXtreme Programming. Motive force behind Design Patterns. Smalltalk and OO thought leader. The godfather of all those who care about code :  
*You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.*
